# Introduction to `sdtm.oak`

## About the package {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Sponsored by CDISC COSA, pharmaceutical companies, including Roche,
    Pfizer, GSK, Vertex, Atorus Research, Pattern Institute, Transition
    Technologies Science.
-   Part of the pharmaverse Group of packages.
-   Inspired by the Roche's `roak` package.
-   Addresses a critical gap in the pharmaverse suite by enabling study
    programmers to create SDTM datasets in R, complementing the existing
    capabilities for ADaM, TLGs, eSubmission, etc.
:::

## Challenges in SDTM Programming {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Although SDTM is simpler with less complex derivations compared to
    ADaM, it presents unique challenges. Unlike ADaM, which uses SDTM
    datasets as its source with a well-defined structure, SDTM relies on
    raw datasets as input.
-   **Raw Data structure** - Different EDC systems produce data in
    different structures, different variable names, dataset names etc.
-   **Varying Data Collection standards** - Although CDASH is available,
    the companies can still develop varying eCRFs using CDASH standards.
:::

## `sdtm.oak` v0.2 {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   v0.2 is avaiable on CRAN.
-   **EDC agnostic** `sdtm.oak` is designed to be highly versatile,
    accommodating varying raw data structures from different EDC systems
    and external vendors.
-   **Data standards agnostic** It supports both CDISC-defined data
    collection standards (CDASH) and various proprietary data collection
    standards defined by pharmaceutical companies.
-   Provides a framework for modular programming, making it a valuable
    addition to the pharmaverse ecosystem.
:::

# Algorithms

## Key concepts

::: incremental
-   The SDTM mappings that transform the collected source data into the
    target SDTM data model are grouped into algorithms.
-   These mapping algorithms form the backbone of {sdtm.oak}
-   Algorithms can be re-used across multiple SDTM domains.
-   **Programming language agnostic** This concept does not rely on a
    specific programming language for implementation.
-   `sdtm.oak` has R functions to represent each algorithm

## Reusable Algorithms

![](reusable_algorithms.jpg){.center}

## Algorithms compared to `dplyr`  {.smaller}

::: incremental
- `sdtm.oak` algorithms enhances `dplyr` functions
  - Allowing users to perform multiple actions within a single function call.
  - Applying if_else condtions, Controlled Terminology in a single function call by providing a simple approach compared to case_when statements.
  - Mapping an SDTM variable only if the source contains data, which is particularly useful when hardcoding.
  - Handling unknown dates, as well as date and time collected in separate or the same raw variables.
  - Adding qualifiers to topic variables using oak id variables.
- While all these can be achieved using `dplyr`, the algorithms in `sdtm.oak` provide a more
  elegant and efficient approach.
:::

# sdtm.oak Programming {.smaller}

## Programming concepts {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Is very close to the key SDTM concepts.
-   Provide a straightforward way to do step-by-step SDTM programming in
    R, that is, mapping topic variable and its qualifiers.
-   Programming steps are generic across SDTM domain classes like
    Events, Interventions, Findings
:::

## SDTM Concept

![sdtm concept](sdtm_concept.png){.center}

## Programming steps {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Read Raw datasets
-   Create id vars in the raw dataset
-   Read study controlled terminology
-   Map Topic Variable
-   Map Rest of the variables
-   Repeat Map topic and Map rest for every topic variable
-   Create SDTM derived variables
-   Add Lables and Attributes
:::

## oak id vars {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Raw data can be in long format, where each piece of collected data
    is represented as a column.
-   In SDTM mappings, transposing may be necessary to create multiple
    records from a single row in a raw dataset (e.g., HEIGHT and WEIGHT
    in the VS domain).
-   Alternatively, a single row in an SDTM domain can be created from
    one row of the raw dataset (e.g., AETERM from the adverse events raw
    dataset).
-   Qualifiers need to be mapped to their corresponding topic variables.
-   The OAK ID variables are a combination of `patient number`, 
    `row number of the raw dataset`, and `raw source name`.
-   These id variables provide key linkage between the
    SDTM datasets and the raw datasets during programming.

# Workshop - Create DM domain

## Review specs

Review aCRF

-  [Demographics_aCRF](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverseraw/blob/main/vignettes/articles/aCRFs/Demographics_aCRF.pdf)
-  [Exposure_as_collected_aCRF](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverseraw/blob/main/vignettes/articles/aCRFs/Exposure_as_collected_aCRF.pdf)
-  [Subject_Disposition_aCRF](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverseraw/blob/main/vignettes/articles/aCRFs/Subject_Disposition_aCRF.pdf)

## Reference date derivation

-   DM domain has reference date variables like RFSTDTC, RFENDTC, RFICDTC, RFPENDTC.
-   Usually the programming logic includes deriving this as a minimum or maximum date
    from the raw data across multiple eCRFs.
-   `oak_cal_ref_dates` function can help users derive these reference dates
    based on the metadata provided in a configuration file - `ref_date_config_df`.
-   Users have to prepare this additional metadata file to derive reference dates.

## Reference date configuration file

-   An intuitive way to let {sdtm.oak} know where to look for the reference dates.
-   Multiple eCRFs or raw datasets and variables can be specified to derive a specific
    reference date. The columns in the file are
-   raw_dataset_name : Name of the raw dataset. 
-   date_var : Date variable name from the raw dataset. 
-   time_var : Time variable name from the raw dataset. 
-   dformat : Format of the date collected in raw data. 
-   tformat: Format of the time collected in raw data. 
-   sdtm_var_name : Reference variable name.

## Code Walkthrough

Run the code and explain to the users

## Recap

Did we review the following in the code?

-   Mapping one topic variable and its qualifies at a time
-   Mapping qualifiers common to all topic variables
-   Usage of `oak_id_vars`

## Quiz - 2
